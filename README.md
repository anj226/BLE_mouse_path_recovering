# BLE_mouse_path_recovering
(2022 CNS Final Project)

## Dependency
* Python3
* pycryptodome (python3 -m install pycryptodome)

## About
We implement a simple eavesdropper for recovering the path of BLE mouse using BLE Legacy pairing.
This repository only has the code we use to convert the packet datas to real mouse trace, the data in example.json is gotten by our Bluetooth Sniffer (nRF52840 Dongle) and Wireshark.
